# Random Dog Viewer

A mini app that displays a random dog image every time you click the button. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, this app fetches images from the free [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and updates the UI in real time.

Users can:
- Click a button to fetch a random dog image
- View high-resolution dog photos with a responsive layout
